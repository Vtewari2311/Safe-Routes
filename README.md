# Safe-Routes
The project is a route planning and navigation platform designed to provide users with the safest route between their origin and destination. Unlike traditional mapping tools that focus on speed, this platform prioritizes safety by considering various factors such as road conditions, traffic patterns, pedestrian density, and crime rates in real-time.

Users can input their desired origin and destination, and the platform will generate a custom route that takes into account the safety of the journey. The route is displayed on a map and accompanied by turn-by-turn directions and safety-related information such as average traffic speed, road safety ratings, and incident reports.

Additionally, the platform integrates with various data sources, including government traffic and crime data, to provide users with real-time updates and alerts about potential hazards along their route. Users can also provide feedback and ratings for their journeys, which helps improve the accuracy of the platform's safety predictions.

This project aims to enhance road safety by providing users with the information they need to make informed decisions about their travel routes and make the roads safer for everyone.
